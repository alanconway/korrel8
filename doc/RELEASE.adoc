= Releasing a new version

Steps to release a new version X.Y.Z, for maintainers.

On branch `main`:

Update CHANGELOG.md to reflect changes since last release, add the new release header.
Follow http://keepachangelog.com[these guidelines]. +
You can list git changes with:

  git log --oneline $(git describe --abbrev=0)..

Edit Makefile and set 'VERSION=X.Y.Z' for the new release. Prepare for release:

  make clean; make pre-release REGISTRY_BASE=quay.io/korrel8r


Use `git status` to verify that all changes are related to the version number change.

Commit and merge to `origin/main` with message 'Release X.Y.Z'

Commit the release:

  make release REGISTRY_BASE=quay.io/korrel8r

This does the following:

- `make clean` and re-build, verify nothing changes and the working tree is clean.
- Creates and pushes the git tag 'vX.Y.Z'
- Updates the 'latest' image tag to point to the new images.
