== Command Line Interface

[source,terminal]
.Install the korrel8r executable:
----
go install github.com/korrel8r/korrel8r/cmd/korrel8r@latest
----

[source,terminal]
.Getting help
----
korrel8r -h
korrel8r list -h
----

To use the command line tool against a Kubernetes cluster, log into your cluster with admin privileges.
For an Openshift cluster you can use the default configuration URL to test korrel8r.

== Kubernetes Operator

There is a community operator for Korrel8r on OperatorHub.
It has been tested with {rh-ocp}, it may or may not work with other k8s clusters.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator permissions on an {rh-ocp} cluster version 4.12 or newer.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html[Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator] version 5.8.1 or newer provided by {red-hat}.
* You have installed the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/log_storage/installing-log-storage.html#logging-loki-gui-install_installing-log-storage[Loki Operator] version 5.8.1 or newer provided by {red-hat}, and have created a `LokiStack` custom resource (CR).
* You have https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html#configuring-log-storage-cr_cluster-logging-deploying[created a `ClusterLogging` CR] that configures LokiStack as the log store.

.Procedure

. In the {rh-console} go to `Home > Console > Operators > OperatorHub`
. Type "korrel8r" in the filter box and select the Korrel8r Community tile +
  image:images/operatorhub-tile.png[Korrel8r Community Tile]
. Click Install, Install again, and you are done!

NOTE: By default the operator is installed in namespace `korrel8r`. +
You can change this during install.

=== Default Korrel8r instance
:instance-ns: korrel8r
:instance-name: korrel8r-instance
:instance-role: view
:instance-sa: system:serviceaccount:
:user-facing-roles: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles

The simplest way to run Korrel8r is to create the special _default instance_
in the namespace where the operator was installed (usually `{instance-ns}`) with name `{instance-name}`.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
.Example of a default Korrel8r instance.
----
apiVersion: korrel8r.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: Korrel8r
metadata:
  name: korrel8r-instance <1>
  namespace: {instance-ns} <2>
  spec: <3>
----

<1> Required name `{instance-name}` for the default instance.
<2> Required namespace `{instance-ns}` for the default instance.
<3> If `spec` is absent or empty, Korrel8r uses a default configuration
    that connects to the default signal stores for {rh-ocp}, and integrates with the {rh-console}. +
    You can customize the behaviour of the default instance by adding `spec` fields.

NOTE: This examples assume the operator is installed in the namespace `{instance-ns}`. +
Modify the example accordingly if it is installed in a different namespace.

[NOTE]
====
A `ClusterRoleBinding` for the _default instance_ is installed as part of the operator.
It binds the standard kubernetes `clusterrole/{instance-role}` to the default instance `ServiceAccount`.
You do not need to create this binding or service account.

This allows the default instance to read most cluster resources and connect to observability stores like Prometheus and Loki.
See the link:{user-facing-roles}[Kubernetes RBAC documentation] for details of the `view` role.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
.Default instance ClusterRoleBinding installed with the operator. You do not need to create this binding.
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: korrel8r
  name: korrel8r-instance
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: korrel8r-instance
  namespace: korrel8r
----
====

=== Non-default instances

You can create other instances of Korrel8r in any namespace, with any name.
You need to create your own `ClusterRoleBinding` or `RoleBinding` for non-default instances.
You do not need to create `ServiceAccount`, the operator will do that automatically.

[soure,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
.Example ClusterRoleBinding for Korrel8r my-name in my-namespace.
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding <1>
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-role-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view <2>
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount <3>
  name: my-name
  namespace: my-namespace
----

<1> You can also create a `RoleBinding` to restrict Korrel8r to a single namespace.
    This will limit correlation results to resources in that namespace.
<2> You can modify the role to restrict what your Korrel8r instance can read.
    Korrel8r's functionality will be limited to resources and stores it can access.
<3> The operator creates a `ServiceAccount` with the same namespace and name as the `Korrel8r` instance.
    Your `ClusterRoleBinding` or `RoleBinding` should use this as its subject.
    You do not need to create this `ServiceAccount`.

[id="using-ocp-console"]
== OpenShift Console Integration

.Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have xref:#installing-korrel8r-ocp[installed Korrel8r]
- The the Korrel8r operator must be installed in `namespace korrel8r`
- Create the "default instance" of the `Korrel8r` resource as described above.

.Procedure
. Refresh the web console
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Logs*. Click the *Metrics* link to see correlated metrics of each log record.
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Alerting*, and click an alert. Alerts that have related logs have a *see related logs* link.

[TIP]
====
Not all alerts have a *see related logs* link. Only alerts that are _related_ to container workloads can have related logs. For example, `KubePodCrashLooping` is related to a pod and so can have related logs. See the xref:troubleshooting.adoc#troubleshooting-no-related-logs[There is no "see related logs" link] documentation for more information.
