. Click Install, Install again, and you are done!

NOTE: By default the operator is installed in namespace `openshift-operators`. +
You can change this during install.

You can now create a "Korrel8r" instance in any namespace.

NOTE: A Korrel8r instance with no additional configuration will connect to default signal stores for  {rh-ocp}, and integrate with the {rh-console}.
You can xref:configuring-korrel8r.adoc#configuring-korrel8r[customize the configuration] to use alternate stores.
